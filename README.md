#Work-related stress is a prevalent issue that affects millions of individuals worldwide, particularly in high-stress professions. Prolonged exposure to stress factors such as high workload, lack of autonomy, and long hours can have serious consequences on employee health, leading to physical and mental health problems, as well as an increased risk of chronic conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and heart disease. This affects the healthy work-life balance and has negative impacts on employee health.
